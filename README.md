All files are organised with respect to:

- ex1.py files: Point Processing
- ex2.py files: Area Processing
- ex3.py files: Morphology
- ex4.py files: Feature Detection

Please note that all files were previously organised in their own
individual directory, but there were difficulties in importing methods
from other python files in external directeries, and hence they are now
all placed in the root folder. This allows methods (most particularly the
implemented thresholding method) to be cleanly imported by various lab
exercises.
